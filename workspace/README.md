Anthony Keogh: student in code institute - full stack development.
This is a website about the rolling stones rock band that’s been going for the last 50 years and my main aim was to give it character, colourful, vibrant, fun and a website worth going back because it sums the rolling stones up and how they portray themselves. If you didn’t throw wild, bold and extravagant design at this website then you wouldn’t be doing justice to the users (fans) that follow them. The navigation of the website is very easy and simple to use, from looking at the latest album, new single, concert dates to the merchandise which are all very easy to find. The background image of the home page provide a stunning old image of the band, with a smoky grey classic look to it, which is fitting for the home page.
    The album page is short and sweet, which is a link to the original rolling stones website albums, because they created so many albums I decided to just put the best three albums and link these to the original rolling stones website. For the album page i kept it the same theme and look. The tour page is very easy and simple to look at, navigate to and shares similar design of the other pages, except i changed the back image which looks very pleasing on the eye. The about page is very quirky and fun to look at and read detailing the boys rise to fame from when they were kids to when they were adults on the road. The merchandise page is similar to the merchandise section on the home page where there is an option to add more items later.

Objective of project from code institute to CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND
•	Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
•	The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
•	Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
•	Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
•	The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
•	Photos of the band members
•	A video clip
•	Audio clips
•	Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
•	Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
•	Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
•	Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
•	Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
•	We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
•	The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
•	You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
